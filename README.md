## [TYPEWriter Projects](https://amanvermaofficial.github.io/Simple-Js-Project/TypeWriter/)
The Typewriter Project is a simple JavaScript application that simulates the effect of a typewriter typing out text on a webpage. This project utilizes asynchronous JavaScript techniques such as `setInterval` and `setTimeout` to achieve the typewriter effect.
